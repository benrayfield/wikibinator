Node.v    --red--> Node.
Node.l    --green--> Node.
Node.r    --blue--> Node.
Node.step --white--> Node.
<br><br>
Due to there being so many turing-colors (in Color.java),
each node might be displayed as a generated icon, such as to say a cbt2048 or cbt32 or cbt4
or the WIKI node will have its own icon and theres only 2 of them
(theres an isDirty and !isDirty form of everything).
